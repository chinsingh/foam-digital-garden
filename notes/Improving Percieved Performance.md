# Improving Percieved Performance

[[Perceived Performance]] can be improved by improving continuity in the UI:

- Smooth movements
- Appearances/disappearences of objects
- Transition
- Additional and timely Feedback
- Responsiveness
- UI Design

âš  Improving Perceived Performance may lead to worse objective performance
=> should be in balance.
