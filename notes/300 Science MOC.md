## Philosophy of Science

- [[Einstein Synchronization Convention]]

- [[Measuring Speed of Light]]
- [[One-way speed of light can't be measured]]

[[Inertia]]
[[Inertial Frame of Reference]]

[[Gravity and space-time in Newtonian mechanics]]

## Mathematics

All of mathematics is based on [[The Axiomatic Method]]

### Geometry

[[Geodesic]]s

## Physics

### Electromagnetism

- [[Electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light]]

### Astronomy

- [[Apsis]]
  - [[Farthest point on orbit is apo, nearest is peri + greek suffix for the primary body]]
- [[Apsidal Precession]]

### Relativity

- [[Light pointed perpendicular to the direction of motion of an accelerating body will bend wrt the body]]
- [[Matter Bends Space-time]]
- [[Bent Sheet Analogy for curved space-time is misleading]]
- [[Principle of Relativity]]
- General Theory of Relativity:
  - [[Matter Bends Space]]
  - [[Matter Bends Time]]
  - [[A Man on Earth and a Man in Space]]
  - [[Body free falling is same as body in space in uniform velocity]]
  - [[Body placed in gravity is same as a body in space accelerating]]
  - Phenomenons [[Explained by General Relativity]]
    - [[Apsidal Precession in Mercury]]
    - [[Light bends when passing near the sun]]
    - [[Clocks on Earth are slower than clocks on ISS]]
  - [[Keeping GPS satellites and earth in sync]]
  - [[Black Hole]]
- Special Theory of Relativity:
  - [[Constancy of light speed]]
  - [[Time Dilation]]

### [[Black Hole]]s

- [[Singularity]]

[[Quantum Gravity]]

## Biology
