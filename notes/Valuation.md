## [[PE Ratio]]

- Look at past few years P/E: Obviously, P/E keeps changing with the share price. Have a look at the past few years' P/E to get the real picture.
- Find the reason behind high P/E. Don't run away just because high P/E makes it look expensive. A [[high PE Ratio doesn't mean expensive]]
  - Look at the Profit growth chart to understand why P/E has higher than the past few years. Has the profit also increased? Is P/E growth justified?
  - Compare the current P/E with historical P/E and compare that with the profit growth.
- P/E ratio can't be used
  - for companies which donâ€™t have any earning like companies which are currently not earning, have made a large investment in current year or those in loss as [[PE Ratio of companies which have no earnings is zero]]
  - to value all profit earning companies. It can only be used in cases where earnings are very stable. For example, it canâ€™t be used in industries like real estate.

## [[Enterprise Value]]

- [[Enterprise Value is a more accurate indicator of the price of a company than Market Capitalization]]
- Don't buy on basis of just enterprise value. Its an important indicator to save you from blunders. Analyze why the enterprise value of a company is, the way it is.

## [[PB ratio]]

At a glance, it seems like the lower the P/B, the better. But [[PB ratio and Book value are not apt indicators for all industries]]

## [[Dividend]]

- [[Dividend Policy is decided on the basis of reinvestment plans]]

- ðŸ’¡ PSUs where enterprise value negative (due to high cash balance) and high dividend yield and price is currently at a multi-year low (panic time) can be a good investment option.*

    **subject to further research.*

## Shareholding Pattern

- [[High and increasing promoter holding along with Low Promoter Pledging is a good sign]]
- [[FII and DII holdings should be high for professionally managed companies]]

## Return on Equity (ROE)

[[ROE is more important indicator than Profit Margin]]
